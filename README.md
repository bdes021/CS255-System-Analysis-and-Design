# CS255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project involved designing a web-based system for a new company focused on preparing customers for their DMV driving tests. The client, DriverPass, represented by Liam (owner) and Ian (IT officer), wanted a system that allowed students to register, schedule driving lessons, access online courses and practice tests, and track their progress. They also needed the system to handle internal staff operations, such as managing reservations, updating customer information, and receiving DMV updates. The system had to be cloud-hosted, accessible through mobile and desktop devices, and secure.

What did you do particularly well?

One area I feel I did particularly well was clearly identifying the client’s functional and nonfunctional requirements and translating those into specific system features. I made sure that each customer and staff need was directly linked to a system function or security measure. This made me excel in the later stages of creating diagrams and system models as they were much more straightforward and consistent.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could choose one part of my work to revise, I would spend more time enhancing the visual diagrams, like the activity and sequence diagrams. Although they captured the necessary steps and relationships, improving the clarity and polish of the diagrams would make the overall design even more professional and easier for a client to understand at a glance.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

When interpreting the user’s needs, I focused heavily on breaking down what the owner and the IT officer described into real-world tasks and simple actions. I designed the system so that each user, whether a student, instructor, secretary, or admin, had all the tools needed to complete their work with no hassle. Considering the user’s needs is critical because a system’s success depends on how easily and effectively the users can interact with it. A system that technically works but frustrates or confuses users is a bad system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When approaching software design, I like to start by gathering all available information, identifying who will use the system and what tasks they need to accomplish. I break down these tasks into detailed steps, and then create visual models like use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and class diagrams to organize the system logically. In the future, I would continue using this structured approach, but I would also prioritize early feedback from the client using mock-ups—to catch any confusion or missed features before a lot of time is spent on the wrong things.
